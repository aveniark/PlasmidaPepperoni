1. Study information, view lectures, webinars
2. Search for the adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome on the NCBI server
3. Download the FASTA file and open it in the programugene
4. Search for a spike protein responsible for attacking antibodies when infected with Sars-Cov-2
5. A protein was found On the NCBI server, downloaded and viewed in Eugene
6. Formatting a protein sequence into a nucleotide sequence using the tBLASTn program and downloading it
7. Search for restriction centers and select the desired restriction endonuclease (MspI) in the AAV virus
8. Replacing the virus section between restriction sites with the SARS-Cov2 virus nucleotide sequence option 1
9. Entering this sequence in BLAST, 30% match, realized that the wrong variant 1
10. Search for epitopes based on the amino acid sequence Of the s-protein of the SARS-Cov-2 virus option 2
11. Based on the table, we selected the lowest value (the largest relationship) and the optimal length, taking into account the length of the AAV virus nucleotide pairs
12. Search for an identical nucleotide sequence in BLAST, 100% match with spike glycoprotein (recombinant coronavirus)
13. Insertion of the recombinant coronavirus nucleotide sequence into the AAV gene
14. Translation to the amino acid sequence (1292 amino acids > 900, which is required) (realized that the wrong way)
15. New translation of an epitope into a nucleotide sequence using the MolBiol program (option 3)
16. Insertion of the epitope itself (the nucleotide sequence) into the AAV virus gene
17. Translation of the obtained nucleotide sequence into an amino acid sequence (MolBiol program)
18. Obtaining 41 amino acids < 900 amino acids, which is required (final version)
